## Styling 101 <i class="fas fa-paint-brush"></i>

**This is bold** and this is *italic*. You can create an *absolute* link [like this one](https://twitter.com/askpascalandy). You can create a *relative* link to pages and posts within your [own website](../style-guide/).

Sometimes you want to have your visitor open a **link into a new tab**. This is where you can <a href="https://twitter.com/askpascalandy" target="_blank">find me on Twitter</a>

Everyone loves straight to the point **bullet points**:

- The first rule is: Be honest
- The second rule is: See rule number one
- Rule number #3 should be here too


**Fancy elements**:

The <s>s element</s> example
The <mark>mark element</mark> example
The <samp>samp element</samp> example
The <small>small element</small> example
The <sub>sub element</sub> example
The <sup>sup element</sup> example
The <kbd>kbd element</kbd> example

**Horizontal bar** is made by using three minus signs `---`.

<a id="table"></a>

## Table & Grid <i class="fas fa-table"></i>

There are three ways to create a table. We recommand to use the first or second method.

1. **Grid table**
2. **Markdown table**
3. **HTML table**

<br>

## 1) Grid table

The **best way** to create a complex table is to use the grid system. We use [this
one](http://thisisdallas.github.io/Simple-Grid/). Below, is a classic **pricing table** with a ratio of: `10/12` on the
left and `2/12` on the right.

<br><br>

### Our Pizzas

<br>

<div class="grid">
  <div class="col-10-12 mobile-col-10-12">
    <div class="content">
      <strong>The Montréal Special</strong><br>
      <em>Fresh basil, mozzarella and olive oil, mozzarella di buffala (+$4), Anchovies (+ $1)</em>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-2-12 mobile-col-2-12">
    <div class="content push-right">
      <strong>$21</strong>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="grid">
  <div class="col-10-12 mobile-col-10-12">
    <div class="content">
      <strong>Quattro Formaggi</strong><br>
      <em>Mozzarella, Aosta Valley fontina, parmesan and spicy provolone</em>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-2-12 mobile-col-2-12">
    <div class="content push-right">
      <strong>18$</strong>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="grid">
  <div class="col-10-12 mobile-col-10-12">
    <div class="content">
      <strong>The Meat Lover</strong><br>
      <em>Fresh basil, Prosciutto crudo, mozzarella and arugula</em>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-2-12 mobile-col-2-12">
    <div class="content push-right">
      <strong>24$</strong>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Corporate services

Let's go deepter. See how we use `&nbsp;` (non breakable space) in order to create a *whitespace* in the two tables
below:

<br>
<div class="grid">
  <div class="col-10-12 mobile-col-10-12">
    <div class="content">
      <strong>The Blue plan includes:</strong><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;🎨 Publish original content on 3 social networks<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;🎨 Once a day<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;🎨 5 days a week<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;🎨 Billed each month
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-2-12 mobile-col-2-12">
    <div class="content push-right">
      <strong>$1475</strong>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<br>
<div class="grid">
  <div class="col-10-12 mobile-col-10-12">
    <div class="content">
      <strong>The Green plan includes:</strong><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="far fa-check-square"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish original content on 3 social networks<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="far fa-check-square"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice a day<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="far fa-check-square"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;5 days a week<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="far fa-check-square"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Billed each month
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-2-12 mobile-col-2-12">
    <div class="content push-right">
      <strong>$2495</strong>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br>

#### Going fancy

Without whitespaces (using `&nbsp;`), it's not as cute.

<br>
<div class="grid">
  <div class="col-10-12 mobile-col-10-12">
    <div class="content">
      <strong>The purple plan includes:</strong><br>
      <i class="far fa-check-square"></i> Publish original content on 3 social networks<br>
      <i class="far fa-check-square"></i> Twice a day<br>
      <i class="far fa-check-square"></i> 5 days a week<br>
      <i class="far fa-check-square"></i> Billed each month
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-2-12 mobile-col-2-12">
    <div class="content push-right">
      <strong>$2495</strong>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

This text is used as a placeholder. Words that will follow won't make any sense and this is fine. At the moment, the goal is to build a structure for our site.

## 2) Markdown table

A more straightforward way to create tables is to use Markdown. 

**Allignement:** the description is on the  left, the price is on the right 

| Description                   | Price |
| :-----------------------------| ----: |
| Black top pomade              | $25   |
| Fiber pomade                  | $20   |
| Free form cream               | $24   |
| Matte pomade paste            | $24   |

<br>

This text is used as a placeholder. Words that will follow won't make any sense and this is fine. At the moment, the goal is to build a structure for our site.

**Allignement:** description is left, price is left 

| Description                   | Price |
| :-----------------------------| :--- |
| Black top pomade              | $25  |
| Fiber pomade                  | $20  |
| Free form cream               | $24  |
| Matte pomade paste            | $24  |

<br>

Here is an example with **three** columns.

| Name          | Details        | Cost  |
| ------------- | :------------: | -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned  | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered       |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat       |    $1 |

<br>

Here is an example with **four** columns. You see that you don't have to align your Markdown perfectly to export a beautiful table.

| Fistname      | Lastname       | City        | Age  |
| :------------ | :--------------| :-----------| :----|
| Jimmy         | Row            | Montréal    | 26   |
| Martine       | Nadal          | Québec      | 32   |
| Philippe      | Green          | Seatle      | 43   |
| Mary          | Woodstock      | Edmunston   | 22   |

<br>

This text is used as a placeholder. Words that will follow won't make any sense and this is fine. At the moment, the goal is to build a structure for our site.

## 3) HTML table

The third way of creating a table is with pure HTML.

### Variation A

      <th>Lastname</th>
      <th>Age</th>

  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

### Variation B

<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width:72%;">Item green</td>

      <td style="width:28%;">Item red</td>
      <td>$24</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Item yellow</td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<a id="form"></a>

## Form

There are many ways to embed a form into your website. The classic use case is to have a **contact us** form.

### Option #1 | formspree

[formspree](https://formspree.io/) is the most straightforward way to have a form on any website. Use the code below and use your email. In this example we use `youremail@here.com`. formspree will send you an email to confirm your email and you will start to receive your messages.

<form method="POST" action="https://formspree.io/youremail@here.com">
  <div><input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email"></div><br>
  <div><textarea name="message" placeholder="Your message"></textarea></div><br>
  <button class="btn_a primary" type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<br>

This text is used as a placeholder. Words that will follow won't make any sense and this is fine. At the moment, the goal is to build a structure for our site.

### Option #2 | third party service

You can also use a third party service like [Wufoo](https://www.wufoo.com/) or [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/).

<iframe height="401" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="width:100%;border:none" src="https://firepressorg.wufoo.com/embed/zyr0snn1ad9rvs/">
</iframe>

This is a placeholder text to give context. You are about to read words that won't make sense, and this is fine. At the moment, the goal is to build a structure for our site.


### Option #3 | via your CRM

Maybe you want something more organized than a simple email. What about having all your messages going thru a CRM? [See this example](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/206058268-How-to-create-a-form-with-Airtable) by Airtable.

<a id="anchor"></a>

## Anchor <i class="fas fa-anchor"></i>

Very practical when you want your user to navigate within a big page. We usually use it to create a **Table of content**.  How use anchors on https://firepress.org/en/faq/.

* [Code Block](#codeblock)
* [Start your trial](#trial)

<a id="footnote"></a>

## Footnote <i class="fas fa-check"></i>

Using a footnote is a great way to credit or reference something in your content [^1]. Most people use it when they have a lot of references in their content [^2]. 

This text is used as a placeholder. Words that will follow won't make any sense and this is fine. From FirePress FAQ's section [^3], we can understand that the goal is to build a structure for our site.

<a id="redirection"></a>

## Redirect traffic to a new page <i class="fas fa-directions"></i>

This is a pure HTML trick. Redirect the traffic from a webpage to another one is useful in cases you want to **rename** a page.

For example, you have two pages: **A** is your old page, **B** is your new page. Instead of renaming page **A**, create a new page **B** and use this script on page **A** to redirect traffic on page **B**.

This way, the traffic that is still pointing to page **A** doesn't break, and page **B** will be loaded.

Create an HTML card and use this script below:

```
The content on: https://firepress.org/about is now here:
https://firepress.org/en/tag/about/

(You will be redirected automatically in few seconds.)

<script type="text/javascript">
      window.location.href = "https://firepress.org/en/tag/about/"
</script>
```
